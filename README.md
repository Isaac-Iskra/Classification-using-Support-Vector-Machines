# Classification-using-Support-Vector-Machines
Going through examples and material covered in Support Vector Machines


In this chapter of the boo, I learned abou how Support Vector Machines help in classification problems.  I learned about the formula for finding the hyperplane as well as the two accompoanying margins.
Fortunately, Scikit-learn provides the classes needed for training models using SVM, and with the paraeters returned, I can plot the hyperplane and margins visually so that I can understand how SVM works.  
I also learned about the various kernels that I can apply to my SVM algorithms so that the dataset can be separated linearly.
